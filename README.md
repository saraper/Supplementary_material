The GINsim file of the IBD-IEC logical model, and its documentation including literature supporting the biological interactions and the logical rules, are provided in the **Model-folder**. The IBD-IEC model displayed in a hierarchical layout can also be found in the folder. Moreover, the bulk RNA sequential datasets are gathered in the **RNA datasets-folder, and the R code and results from Hallmark gene set and Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis can be found in the **Enrichment analysis-folder**.
